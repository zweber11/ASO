A. App indexing with Firebase: Key Capabilities
  >Display app in search results
  >Associates your app & website, app card shows next to your website card
  >Autocompletion in Google Search
B. Steps to Set Up Firebase
  1. Support HTTP URLs in your app
  2. Add the App Indexing SDK to your app
  3. Test your implementation
  4. Track in Google Search Console, which monitors the performance of your app indexing. 
C. Deep linking - Method to take users to a specific location in a mobile app.
  >Deep links are important, as they attract new users to your app, and provide a better user experience, which helps user retention.
  >Example: use the <link rel="alternate" href="ios-app://myUniqueAppID/asdf"> tag, which takes them to your app as opposed to another location on your site.
D. Traditional vs. Deferred Deep Links
  >Traditional deep linking: Directs users to the content in your app or on your mobile website
  >Deferred deep linking: Directs users to app store and then to the desired content within your app
  >How Deferred deep links work 
    -User clicks deep link, directed to app/play store, installs app, app checks for deep link (SDK DB), deferred link provided to app, app opens to appropriate page/screen with desired content.
